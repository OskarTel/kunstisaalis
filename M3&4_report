Project Title: Know the art period
Authors: Oskar Telgmaa (Group 4), Anna Ulst (Group 3)

BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING:
Identifying your business goals
  Background: 
    None of us wants to be the fool of the group. People don't want to stand out as the one that doesn't know certain facts about the subjects that others might find elementary knowledge.
  For us that is the arts. It's something interesting and beautiful to look at, but when it comes to discussing authors or art theory, we do seem to get lost. Most times, the most difficult part
  of art is recognizing the artist by just looking at the painting. Many concider this to be quite easy. But there are many people who need som
  Business goals: 
    We are trying to create a helpful tool, that identifies the painter and the art movement of the painting, it has been given.
  Business success criteria:
    As we have the data of 50 most influencial painters of all time the objective is to identify the paintings of these 50 painters only. A bigger data set can be left for later, done outside 
    of the school project.
Assessing your situation
  Inventory of resources :
    Resources for this project is two students, who take 'Introduction to data mining' and the knowledge they have obtained from that course.

  Costs and benefits :
    We don't have costs for this project, except our time. We won't benefit from this project financially either, but we get to practice our skills in data mining.

DATA UNDERSTANDING:
Gathering data
  Outline data requirements
  Verify data availability
  Define selection criteria
Describing data
Exploring data
Verifying data quality

PLANNING THE PROJECT:
Task List:
 1) Make data usable for our purpose (read in pictures as pixels)
 2) Write script which can read in the data in more effective way, so we can use it further 
 3) Train models on training data just to try to predict the art movement
 4) Train models on training data just to try to predict (or confirm) one author
 5) Test models on larger data (more authors and movements)
Methods and tools we plan to use:
  1) Jupyter Notebook will be our main rescourse in this particular project
  2) We use GitHub to make coding together more simpler
  3) As a comment for the second task, we'll choose random patches from the painting, so we don't have to use all the data and not overwhelm the program
  4) And we try to move gradually from predicting just the art movement to predicting actual authors
